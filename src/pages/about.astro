      <h3>Experience that matters</h3>
      <p>
        I bring over <strong>10 years of drafting experience</strong> in the
        joinery and cabinetry industry, including
        <strong>5 years as a Microvellum Technician</strong> working directly
        with production environments, libraries, and CNC outputs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This ensures drawings are not just visually correct — they are aligned
        with real-world manufacturing processes and workflows.

      <h3>Clear, competitive pricing</h3>
      <p>
        Pricing is <strong>not based on hourly drafting rates</strong>.
        Work is scoped around outcomes and project requirements, allowing
        you to budget with confidence and compare value — not just time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach reflects experience, efficiency, and consistency rather
        than billing for hours spent.
