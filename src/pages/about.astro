  <h1>About MVWorks</h1>

  <p>
    MVWorks specialises in <strong>remote Microvellum drafting</strong> for cabinet makers
    and joinery businesses that need reliable, production-ready documentation.
  </p>

  <h2>Experience that matters</h2>

  <p>
    I bring over <strong>10 years of drafting experience</strong> in the joinery and cabinetry
    industry, including <strong>5 years as a Microvellum Technician</strong> working directly
    with production environments, libraries, and CNC outputs.
  </p>

  <p>
    This background means drawings are not just visually correct — they are built to align
    with real-world manufacturing processes, materials, and workflows.
  </p>

  <h2>Remote drafting — done properly</h2>

  <p>
    MVWorks provides remote drafting support without sacrificing quality or consistency.
    I work either to your existing standards or help develop clear, repeatable systems
    that reduce errors and rework.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Production-ready shop drawings</li>
    <li>Microvellum product and library configuration</li>
    <li>Standards alignment and drafting workflows</li>
    <li>Technical problem-solving and support</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Clear, competitive pricing</h2>

  <p>
    Pricing is <strong>not based on hourly drafting rates</strong>.
    Instead, work is scoped around outcomes and project requirements,
    allowing you to budget with confidence and compare value — not just time.
  </p>

  <p>
    This approach reflects experience, efficiency, and consistency rather than
    billing for hours spent.
